# bikesharing

Overview

The purpose of this project is the analyze the CitiBike data, in New York City, providing visually appealing and informative data to investors. The investors are looking to provide the bike sharing program in De Moines (Iowa). While, the culture/lifestyles are incredibly different between the two cities, the data provided would still prove useful in, at least, a trial run. 

When going through the data, some questions ought to be asked:

* Who would be our clientele? 
	* Will be they become subscribers or only use the bikes once in a while?
	* Who’s using the bikes the most? 
		* Men, women, other? Ages? Tourists or residence of the area? 
* What are the most common and populated areas? 
* When conducting repairs, when would it be the most optimal time to do so?
	* When are the bikes being used least and most?
	* What bikes are being used the most? 
		* Are these bikes staying in a particular area? 

Results

Once the data from Des Moines begins to grow, questions that are better suited to the area could be asked. Since the culture and lifestyle are radically different would the bike sharing program have to tailor its program to the city, rather than keeping the same one that worked well in NYC? 

When looking at NYC and the usage of Citibikes, an important question to ask is, who is using the bikes? During the month of August, 2019 (where the data was pulled), a vast majority of the people using the bikesharing program had become subscribers. Subscribers pay a monthly fee to use bikes as they desire and could go incredibly distances, for example Manhattan to Queens. It’s safe to assume, those who have subscriptions rely on citibikes for their daily commutes and activities. Those who are simply customers could possibly be tourists (which takes a large part in the city population), people who are testing out the citibikes for a trial run, or curiosity. 

When taking a look at those individuals who use the bikes, based on gender, men are the most likely to use the program. Men take up nearly 65% of programs user base. Another graph that shows male the male dominance breaks down the user type (customer and subscriber), their gender, and their usage throughout the week.

Men are more likely to be subscribers and utilizes the bikes throughout the week, while women are likely to subscribe and use the bikes throughout the week, but not as much as men. Those who are under unknown are less likely to subscribe and use the bikes mainly on the weekend. A question that comes to mind, is why are women less likely to use the program?

A map displaying the most common bike stations, based on where the bike trips, shows Manhattan to be the most popular. Manhattan has a large tourist population and a heavily flow of traffic. A lot of people live, shop, and work in Manhattan thus boosting the heavy flow of traffic in Manhattan. When looking at the map, there are large dark circles throughout, showing those are the most common stations, where people start their trips. The most common bike stations are closer to the piers or along the Hudson, this is because trains (a common form of transportation) are very limited and biking makes it easier to commute, providing convenience. Other popular stations are in the center of Manhattan, mainly below Central Park, where street traffic is overwhelming and train congestion may not be ideal for a lot of people looking to travel 40 blocks. The population density, in Manhattan (that’s incredibly high), and citibikes provide a symbiotic relationship, thus the frequent use of those stations. If one were to look at the station usages in deep Brooklyn and Queens, it’s incredibly low. The need for easy transportation isn’t as critical, the tourist population isn’t necessarily traveling deep into Brooklyn or Queens, which would be a long commute, especially via bike. Most of the rides, don’t last more than 30min, in fact most are about 7 min long. 

When looking at individuals and their trip durations, men yet again, are dominating the actual usage of the bikes. But, it’s interesting to note both men and women seem to normally have a trip duration of about 7min long, but those under unknown seem to develop a plateau from 7min to about 27 min. Men and women show a sudden drop in trip duration after 7 min. It would be interesting to understand, why.

The most common times to use the program is during rush hour, which is 6-10am and 5-7pm Monday thru Friday. Over the weekends (Saturday and Sunday) the most common times are from 9am to 7pm. When taking into consideration times and bike usage, the best time to conduct repairs, updates, bike relocations, etc would be between 2am and 5am. During this period the amount of program interference would be minimal.

Summary

Bringing back the question would the bike sharing program have to tailor its program to the city, rather than keeping the same one that worked well in NYC? The Citibike program is working really well in NYC since there’s so much congestion and its dense population has prominent vehicle, walking, and train traffic. The citibikes provides people with another commuting option. The user base should be addressed, while the program does have a steady base with men, the lack of women should be addressed. Why are women less likely to use the program? If there a safety issue? Is it just not appealing? The bikes get used frequently, mainly during rush hours (morning and evening) and during the weekend.
